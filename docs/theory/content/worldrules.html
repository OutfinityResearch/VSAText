<h1>World Rules & World Building</h1>

<p class="lead">World rules define the laws - physical, magical, social, or technological - that govern your story's universe. They create the boundaries within which your plot operates and give your world its unique identity.</p>

<section id="overview">
  <h2>What Are World Rules?</h2>
  
  <p>World rules are the fundamental constraints and possibilities that distinguish your story's universe from our own. They answer questions like:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Is magic possible? If so, what are its costs and limitations?</li>
    <li>What level of technology exists? What can and can't it do?</li>
    <li>How is society organized? What are the power structures?</li>
    <li>What are the physical laws? (gravity, time, geography)</li>
    <li>What supernatural or fantastical elements exist?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <blockquote>
    "Worldbuilding is not about creating a complete world - that's impossible. It's about creating the illusion of a complete world while actually only developing what your story needs."
    <cite>Brandon Sanderson</cite>
  </blockquote>

    <div class="info-box-title">The Iceberg Principle</div>
    <p>Like Hemingway's iceberg theory, your readers should see only 10% of your worldbuilding on the page. The other 90% exists to give you confidence and consistency, ensuring that what they do see feels authentic.</p>

<section id="consistency">
  <h2>The Principles of Consistency</h2>
  
  <p>Once established, world rules must remain consistent. Breaking them destroys reader trust and narrative tension.</p>
  
  <h3>Consistency Guidelines</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Establish Early</strong> - Introduce important rules before they become crucial</li>
    <li><strong>Demonstrate, Don't Explain</strong> - Show rules in action rather than lecturing</li>
    <li><strong>Exceptions Need Justification</strong> - If a rule can be broken, explain why</li>
    <li><strong>Costs Must Be Paid</strong> - If magic or tech has costs, always exact them</li>
    <li><strong>Track Your Rules</strong> - Keep a reference document of established rules</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="warning-box">
    <div class="warning-title">The Deus Ex Machina Problem</div>
    <p>When characters can suddenly do things not established by the rules, or problems are solved by previously unknown capabilities, readers feel cheated. Every solution should be earned through established rules.</p>
  </div>

<section id="hard-soft">
  <h2>Hard Magic vs. Soft Magic</h2>
  
  <p>Brandon Sanderson distinguishes between two approaches to magic systems:</p>
  
  <div class="feature-grid">
    <div class="feature-card">
      <h4>Hard Magic Systems</h4>
      <p><strong>Clear rules, defined limitations</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reader understands how magic works</li>
        <li>Characters can solve problems with magic</li>
        <li>Emphasis on clever use of limitations</li>
        <li>Examples: Mistborn, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Fullmetal Alchemist</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-card">
      <h4>Soft Magic Systems</h4>
      <p><strong>Mysterious, undefined boundaries</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Magic creates wonder and awe</li>
        <li>Not used to directly solve problems</li>
        <li>Emphasis on atmosphere and mystery</li>
        <li>Examples: Lord of the Rings, Narnia, Studio Ghibli films</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="info-box">
    <div class="info-box-title">The Spectrum</div>
    <p>Most systems fall somewhere between hard and soft. Harry Potter is semi-hard: spells have consistent effects, but the limits of what's possible remain mysterious.</p>

<section id="sanderson">
  <h2>Sanderson's Laws of Magic</h2>
  
  <p>Fantasy author Brandon Sanderson has articulated three influential "laws" for creating magic systems:</p>
  
  <h3>First Law: Problem-Solving</h3>
  
  <blockquote>
    "An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic."
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>This means: if you want characters to use magic to solve problems, readers must understand how it works first. Gandalf can't solve problems with magic because we don't understand his limits.</p>
  
  <h3>Second Law: Limitations</h3>
  
  <blockquote>
    "Limitations are more interesting than powers."
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>What your characters <em>can't</em> do is more narratively important than what they can. Limitations create conflict, force creativity, and prevent magic from solving every problem.</p>
  
  <h3>Third Law: Expand Before Adding</h3>
  
  <blockquote>
    "Expand what you have before adding something new."
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Before inventing new magic, explore the implications of existing powers. What are the creative uses? The unexpected applications? The social consequences?</p>
  
  <div class="example-box">
    <div class="example-title">Example: Mistborn's Allomancy</div>
    <p>Sanderson's Allomancy system demonstrates these principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clear Rules</strong>: 16 metals, each with specific powers</li>
      <li><strong>Hard Limitations</strong>: Must ingest metals, metals run out, some are rare</li>
      <li><strong>Costs</strong>: Atium is incredibly expensive, pewter damages body</li>
      <li><strong>Expansion</strong>: Later books reveal new metals were hidden, not invented</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Magic Systems in Literature</h2>
  
  <div class="pattern-card">
    <h4>The One Ring (Lord of the Rings)</h4>
    <div class="pattern-source">J.R.R. Tolkien</div>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong> The Ring grants invisibility, extends life, corrupts the wearer's soul. It can only be destroyed in Mount Doom. It wants to return to Sauron.</p>
    <p><strong>Type:</strong> Soft magic - we never fully understand its limits.</p>
    <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Creates tension through corruption, not power levels.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="pattern-card">
    <h4>The Wheel of Time's One Power</h4>
    <div class="pattern-source">Robert Jordan</div>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong> Channelers weave five elements (Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Spirit). Men's power drives them mad. Women are generally stronger in Air/Water, men in Fire/Earth.</p>
    <p><strong>Type:</strong> Hard magic with soft edges.</p>
    <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Gender divide creates political and personal conflict.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="pattern-card">
    <h4>Sympathy (Kingkiller Chronicle)</h4>
    <div class="pattern-source">Patrick Rothfuss</div>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong> Based on thermodynamics - energy cannot be created. Creating a link between objects allows transferring energy, but always with loss. Mental discipline required.</p>
    <p><strong>Type:</strong> Very hard magic based on physics principles.</p>
    <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Feels scientific, creates puzzle-solving opportunities.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="pattern-card">
    <h4>Harry Potter Magic</h4>
    <div class="pattern-source">J.K. Rowling</div>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong> Wands channel magic. Spells require incantations and wand movements. Some magic is restricted or forbidden. Magical ability is inherited but degree varies.</p>
    <p><strong>Type:</strong> Semi-soft - consistent within scenes but limits unclear.</p>
    <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Accessible to young readers, focuses on character over system.</p>

<section id="scifi-rules">
  <h2>Science Fiction Technology Rules</h2>
  
  <p>In SF, technology replaces magic - but the same principles apply. Rules must be consistent, limitations create conflict, and costs must be paid.</p>
  
  <h3>Key Questions for Tech Rules</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Availability</strong> - Who has access to the technology? (Everyone, elites only, illegal?)</li>
    <li><strong>Reliability</strong> - Does it always work? What causes failure?</li>
    <li><strong>Cost</strong> - What resources does it require? (Energy, rare materials, expertise)</li>
    <li><strong>Side Effects</strong> - What unintended consequences exist?</li>
    <li><strong>History</strong> - How did it develop? Is it improving, stable, or degrading?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="example-box">
    <div class="example-title">Example: Dune's Technology Rules</div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Computers</strong> - The Butlerian Jihad banned thinking machines, leading to human "mentats"</li>
      <li><strong>Shields</strong> - Block fast objects but not slow ones, making knife fighting viable</li>
      <li><strong>Spice</strong> - Required for FTL travel, only found on Arrakis, extends life but is addictive</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These rules create the entire political and military structure of the novel.</p>
  </div>

<section id="ftl">
  <h2>FTL & Space Travel</h2>
  
  <p>Faster-than-light travel is impossible according to known physics, so SF writers must create rules for how their universe handles it:</p>
  
  <h3>Common FTL Approaches</h3>

      <td><strong>Jump Gates</strong></td>
      <td>Fixed infrastructure allows instantaneous travel between points</td>
      <td>Stargate, Mass Effect</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Warp Drive</strong></td>
      <td>Bend space around the ship rather than exceeding lightspeed</td>
      <td>Star Trek</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Folding Space</strong></td>
      <td>Connect two distant points of space directly</td>
      <td>Dune, A Wrinkle in Time</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Generation Ships</strong></td>
      <td>No FTL - accept slow travel, multiple generations</td>
      <td>Rendezvous with Rama</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Cryosleep</strong></td>
      <td>No FTL - travelers frozen for long journeys</td>
      <td>Alien, Interstellar</td>
    </tr>

<section id="ai-rules">
  <h2>AI & Transhumanism Rules</h2>
  
  <p>Stories involving AI, uploaded consciousness, or posthuman entities need clear rules:</p>
  
  <h3>Key Questions</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consciousness</strong> - Are AIs truly conscious? Can consciousness be copied?</li>
    <li><strong>Rights</strong> - What legal/moral status do artificial minds have?</li>
    <li><strong>Limitations</strong> - What can't AI do? (Creativity? Emotion? Physical action?)</li>
    <li><strong>Threat Level</strong> - Is AI controllable? What safeguards exist?</li>
    <li><strong>Humanity Definition</strong> - What makes someone "human" if minds can be uploaded?</li>

  <div class="pattern-card">
    <h4>Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A robot may not injure a human being or allow a human to come to harm</li>
      <li>A robot must obey human orders except where they conflict with the First Law</li>
      <li>A robot must protect its own existence except where that conflicts with the First or Second Law</li>

<section id="society">
  <h2>Society & Political Rules</h2>
  
  <p>Social rules define how power operates, who has status, and what behavior is acceptable.</p>
  
  <h3>Social Structure Elements</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Structure</strong> - Monarchy, democracy, oligarchy, theocracy, anarchy?</li>
    <li><strong>Class System</strong> - Rigid castes, social mobility, meritocracy?</li>
    <li><strong>Gender Roles</strong> - Patriarchy, matriarchy, equality, other arrangements?</li>
    <li><strong>Family Structure</strong> - Nuclear, extended, chosen, collective?</li>
    <li><strong>Religion</strong> - Role of faith, multiple gods, no religion?</li>
    <li><strong>Law & Justice</strong> - Formal courts, blood feuds, trial by combat?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="example-box">
    <div class="example-title">Example: The Handmaid's Tale</div>

      <li>Fertile women are "Handmaids" assigned to Commanders</li>
      <li>Strict color coding indicates social role (red, blue, green, grey)</li>

<section id="economy">
  <h2>Economy & Resources</h2>
  
  <p>Economic rules create conflicts over scarcity, trade, and power:</p>
  
  <h3>Economic World Rules</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scarcity</strong> - What is rare and valuable? (Spice, water, magic crystals)</li>
    <li><strong>Currency</strong> - What serves as money? (Gold, electronic credits, barter)</li>
    <li><strong>Trade</strong> - Who trades with whom? What are trade routes?</li>
    <li><strong>Labor</strong> - Slaves, serfs, free workers, robots?</li>
    <li><strong>Wealth Distribution</strong> - Extreme inequality, relative equality?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="pattern-card">
    <h4>Mad Max: Fury Road Economy</h4>
    <p><strong>Scarce Resources:</strong> Water ("Aqua-Cola"), gasoline ("Guzzoline"), mother's milk, healthy babies</p>
    <p><strong>Power Derived From:</strong> Control of resources, not money</p>
    <p><strong>Currency:</strong> Barter - water for guzzoline for bullets</p>
