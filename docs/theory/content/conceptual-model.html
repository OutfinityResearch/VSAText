<h1>Conceptual Model & Glossary</h1>

<p>This document provides a comprehensive and authoritative reference for all concepts used in SCRIPTA. It defines the core terminology, explains how concepts relate to each other, and establishes the mental model needed to work effectively with the system.</p>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box-title">Why This Matters</div>
  <p>SCRIPTA is a <strong>story specification system</strong>, not a story generator. The visual editor creates precise <em>specifications</em> in CNL (Controlled Natural Language) that describe what a story should contain. These specifications can then drive AI generation, be evaluated for quality, or serve as detailed outlines for human writers.</p>
</div>

<h2>The SCRIPTA Mental Model</h2>

<p>SCRIPTA operates on three interconnected layers:</p>

<div class="feature-grid">
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h4>1. Libraries (Content)</h4>
    <p>Collections of reusable entities: Characters, Locations, Objects, Moods, Themes, World Rules, Wisdom, Patterns, and Dialogues.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h4>2. Structure (Organization)</h4>
    <p>Hierarchical arrangement of the narrative: Book containing Chapters containing Scenes, with references to library entities.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h4>3. Blueprint (Planning)</h4>
    <p>High-level story planning: Narrative arcs, beat mappings, tension curves, and subplots that guide the structure.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Structural Hierarchy</h2>

<p>SCRIPTA organizes narratives in a strict hierarchy. Each level serves a distinct purpose:</p>

<h3>Book</h3>
<p>The root container for the entire narrative. A book encompasses the complete story specification including all chapters, metadata, and global constraints.</p>
<pre><code>Book group begin
  // All chapters and global settings go here
Book group end</code></pre>

<h3>Chapter</h3>
<p>A major division of the narrative, typically representing a significant portion of the story. Chapters contain scenes and can have their own properties like title, summary, and constraints.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>title</td>
    <td>Human-readable chapter name</td>
    <td><code>Chapter1 has title "The Beginning"</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>summary</td>
    <td>Brief description of chapter content</td>
    <td><code>Chapter1 has summary "Hero discovers the quest"</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>constraints</td>
    <td>Rules specific to this chapter</td>
    <td><code>Chapter1 requires "Anna"</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Scene</h3>
<p>The fundamental unit of narrative action. A scene represents a continuous sequence of events in a single location and time. Scenes are where characters interact, events occur, and the story advances.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>title</td>
    <td>Scene name</td>
    <td><code>Sc1 has title "Morning at the Village"</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mood</td>
    <td>Emotional atmosphere</td>
    <td><code>Sc1 has mood Mysterious</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>location</td>
    <td>Where the scene takes place</td>
    <td><code>Sc1 includes location Village</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>characters</td>
    <td>Who appears in the scene</td>
    <td><code>Sc1 includes character Anna</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>actions</td>
    <td>What happens</td>
    <td><code>Anna discovers artifact</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Beat</h3>
<p>A story beat is a specific moment in a narrative arc that marks a significant plot point or emotional shift. Beats are defined by narrative arc templates (like Hero's Journey) and mapped to scenes through the Blueprint system.</p>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box-title">Beats vs. Scenes</div>
  <p><strong>Beats</strong> are abstract narrative markers ("Call to Adventure", "Midpoint", "Climax") defined by storytelling theory. <strong>Scenes</strong> are concrete containers with locations, characters, and actions. The Blueprint maps beats to scenes, giving your story proper pacing and structure.</p>
</div>

<h3>Block</h3>
<p>A reusable narrative building block that encapsulates a common story pattern. Blocks are predefined templates for frequently occurring narrative moments like "Revelation", "Confrontation", "Escape", or "Sacrifice".</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Block Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Typical Use</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>revelation</td>
    <td>Hidden truth comes to light</td>
    <td>Plot twists, character secrets</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>confrontation</td>
    <td>Direct conflict between characters</td>
    <td>Climactic battles, arguments</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sacrifice</td>
    <td>Character gives up something precious</td>
    <td>Heroic moments, tragic choices</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>escape</td>
    <td>Characters flee danger</td>
    <td>Chase sequences, narrow escapes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>reunion</td>
    <td>Separated characters meet again</td>
    <td>Emotional payoffs, family stories</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>betrayal</td>
    <td>Trust is broken</td>
    <td>Villain reveals, ally turns</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Library Concepts</h2>

<h3>Character</h3>
<p>A person, creature, or entity that acts within the story. Characters have:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Archetype</strong>: Role in the story (Hero, Mentor, Shadow, Ally, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>Traits</strong>: Personality characteristics (courage, wisdom, cunning)</li>
  <li><strong>Relationships</strong>: Connections to other characters</li>
  <li><strong>Arc</strong>: How they change through the story</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>Anna is protagonist
Anna has archetype Hero
Anna has trait courage
Anna has trait determination
Anna relates to Gandalf as mentor_student</code></pre>

<h3>Location</h3>
<p>A place where scenes occur. Locations have:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Geography</strong>: Type of place (city, forest, castle, spaceship)</li>
  <li><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: Emotional quality (mysterious, welcoming, threatening)</li>
  <li><strong>Time Period</strong>: When the location exists</li>
  <li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Defining features</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>Village is location
Village has geography rural
Village has atmosphere peaceful
Village has characteristic "ancient stone walls"</code></pre>

<h3>Object (Plot Element)</h3>
<p>Physical items, documents, or artifacts that drive the plot. Objects are often MacGuffins, keys to mysteries, or symbolic items.</p>

<pre><code>SilverKey is artifact
SilverKey has significance high
SilverKey has description "Ancient key that unlocks the forbidden chamber"
Anna owns SilverKey</code></pre>

<h3>Mood</h3>
<p>An emotional register for scenes. Moods combine multiple emotions with varying intensities to create specific atmospheres like "Mysterious", "Triumphant", or "Melancholic".</p>

<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>The underlying message or central idea explored in the story. Themes are abstract concepts like "Redemption", "Power and Corruption", or "Identity" that give the narrative deeper meaning.</p>

<pre><code>Story has theme redemption as primary
Story has theme sacrifice as secondary</code></pre>

<h3>World Rule</h3>
<p>A constraint that defines how the story world operates. World rules establish the physics, magic systems, technology levels, and societal norms of the setting.</p>

<pre><code>World is setting

R1 is world_rule
R1 has text "Magic requires sacrifice"
World includes rule R1

R2 is world_rule
R2 has text "FTL travel causes temporal displacement"
World includes rule R2

R3 is world_rule
R3 has text "Dragons are extinct"
World includes rule R3</code></pre>

<h3>Wisdom</h3>
<p>Philosophical insights, life lessons, and teachings that the story explores or conveys. Wisdom represents the deeper truths the narrative embodies, drawn from sources like Stoicism, Buddhism, Psychology, or universal human experience.</p>

<pre><code>W1 is wisdom
W1 has label "True strength is shown through restraint"
Story includes wisdom W1

W2 is wisdom
W2 has label "Change is the only constant"
Story includes wisdom W2</code></pre>

<h3>Pattern</h3>
<p>A reusable story template or master plot. Patterns are higher-level structures like "Quest", "Revenge", "Rags to Riches", or "Voyage and Return" that define the overall shape of narratives. They can include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Master Plots</strong>: Fundamental story shapes (20+ types)</li>
  <li><strong>Twist Types</strong>: Common surprise structures</li>
  <li><strong>Subplot Patterns</strong>: Secondary story threads</li>
  <li><strong>Character Dynamics</strong>: Relationship patterns (Heist Crew, Found Family)</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>P1 is pattern
P1 has label "Hero's Call"
P1 has variable $hero as character
P1 has variable $location as location

P1 has template begin
  $hero is at $location
  $hero discovers "call to adventure"
P1 has template end</code></pre>

<h3>Relationship</h3>
<p>A connection between two characters that affects how they interact. Relationships have types (ally, enemy, mentor, sibling, romantic) and can change over the course of the story.</p>

<pre><code>Anna relates to Marcus as sibling
Anna relates to Gandalf as mentor_student
Marcus relates to Villain as enemy</code></pre>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<p>A structured conversation specification. Dialogues in SCRIPTA are not full scripts but specifications that define:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Why this conversation happens (reveal, conflict, bonding)</li>
  <li><strong>Participants</strong>: Who speaks and who listens</li>
  <li><strong>Tone</strong>: Emotional register of the exchange</li>
  <li><strong>Exchanges</strong>: Outline of what each character conveys</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blueprint Concepts</h2>

<h3>Narrative Arc</h3>
<p>A predefined template that describes the emotional and structural journey of a story. SCRIPTA includes multiple arc types:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Arc</th>
    <th>Beats</th>
    <th>Best For</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hero's Journey</td>
    <td>12 stages</td>
    <td>Epic adventures, transformational stories</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Three Act Structure</td>
    <td>9 beats</td>
    <td>General fiction, screenplays</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Save the Cat</td>
    <td>15 beats</td>
    <td>Commercial fiction, detailed plotting</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Story Circle</td>
    <td>8 steps</td>
    <td>Character-focused stories</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kishotenketsu</td>
    <td>4 acts</td>
    <td>Stories without central conflict</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Five Act</td>
    <td>5 acts</td>
    <td>Classical drama, tragedies</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Seven-Point</td>
    <td>7 points</td>
    <td>Novels with clear turning points</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Beat Mapping</h3>
<p>The assignment of narrative beats to specific chapters and scenes. Beat mappings connect abstract story structure to concrete narrative content.</p>

<h3>Tension Curve</h3>
<p>A visual representation of emotional intensity across the story. The tension curve plots how much "pressure" the reader feels at each point, typically rising toward the climax and releasing at resolution.</p>

<h3>Subplot</h3>
<p>A secondary story thread that runs alongside the main plot. Subplots have their own arcs and touchpoints but resolve within the context of the main narrative.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Subplot Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>romance</td>
    <td>Romantic relationship development</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>rivalry</td>
    <td>Competition between characters</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mystery</td>
    <td>Puzzle or secret to uncover</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>growth</td>
    <td>Character personal development</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>revenge</td>
    <td>Quest for retribution</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mentorship</td>
    <td>Teaching/learning relationship</td>
  </tr>
</table>
